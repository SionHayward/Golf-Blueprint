# The Golf Blueprint

A data-driven golf course management tool providing analytics-based insights for The Kendleshire Golf Club.

## Project Overview

The Golf Blueprint transforms how amateur golfers approach course management at The Kendleshire Golf Club. By collecting and analyzing shot data from multiple players, the system provides visual heatmaps and strategic recommendations to help golfers make better decisions, avoid trouble areas, and ultimately lower their scores.

Research found 80% of amateur golfers have average or worse understanding of course management, despite this being a crucial factor in performance improvement. This tool bridges that knowledge gap through accessible data visualization.
