# The Golf Blueprint

The Golf Blueprint is a data-driven golf course management tool specifically designed for The Kendleshire Golf Club. Research revealed 80% of amateur golfers have average or worse course management understanding, despite this skill being crucial for improved scoring. The system addresses this gap by collecting and analyzing shot data to generate strategic insights.
The solution features SVG recreations of all 18 holes where users mark their shot locations. A MySQL database stores this information, while custom algorithms transform collected data into color-coded heatmap visualizations showing optimal playing zones and areas to avoid.
Built using Agile methodology with client-server architecture, the system achieved 100% implementation of critical requirements. User benefits include identifying trouble spots, learning strategic approaches, and making smarter decisions on every holeâ€”effectively bringing professional-level analytics to amateur golfers.
